1. Developed a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake with an accuracy of 97% on the test data.
2. Implemented data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to prepare the text data for analysis.
3. Applied stemming and TF-IDF vectorization to convert the textual data into numerical features.
4. Used logistic regression as the classification algorithm and evaluated the model's performance using an accuracy score.
5. Created a predictive system that can classify new unseen news articles as real or fake.
